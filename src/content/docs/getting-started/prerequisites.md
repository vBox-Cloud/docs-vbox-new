Before getting started with vBox, ensure you have the following:

## Account Requirements

- A **Microsoft account** (work or personal) — vBox uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication
- Access granted by your organization's vBox administrator, or a free trial from [vbox-cloud.com](https://www.vbox-cloud.com/)

## Supported Browsers

vBox supports the latest versions of:

- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

## Azure Requirements (for Organization Contributors)

If you are an Organization Contributor (MSP) managing customer environments, the following Azure prerequisites apply:

- **Azure subscription** with appropriate permissions to the resources you want to monitor
- **Microsoft Entra ID** Global Administrator access (required for certain integrations)
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** enabled on subscriptions (for security features)
- **Reader role** at the Management Group level (for AzGovViz integration)

:::note
Organization Readers do not need any Azure permissions — they only need a Microsoft account to sign in and view their assigned organization's data.
