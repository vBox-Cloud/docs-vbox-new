This guide walks you through your first steps with vBox after receiving access.

## Step 1: Enable Features

Configure desired capabilities (Security, Operations, Cost) on your Customer settings page.

## Step 2: Grant Permissions

Follow the integration guides to set up required consent and role assignments:

- [Advanced Application Consent](/integrations/app-consent/) — Grant necessary permissions for advanced vBox features
- [MS Defender XDR Integration](/integrations/defender-xdr/) — Enable CIS M365 Foundation Benchmark recommendations
- [AzGovViz Integration](/integrations/azgovviz/) — Set up Azure Governance Visualizer

## Step 3: Explore Dashboards

Use the main dashboard and summary pages to monitor your Azure environment:

- **Cost Summary** — Overview of your Azure spend and savings opportunities
- **Security Summary** — Your current security posture and top recommendations
- **Operations Summary** — Operational health metrics and improvement areas

:::tip
Start with the Cost Management section to identify quick wins — many organizations find immediate savings opportunities within the first review.
