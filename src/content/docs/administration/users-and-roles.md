vBox supports different user roles with varying access levels to features and data.

## User Roles

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Regular User** | Standard access to dashboards and recommendations | View dashboards, recommendations, cost details; create tasks |
| **MSP** | Managed Service Provider with full access | All regular user permissions plus assessments, workspace management, customer management |
| **Account Manager** | Customer relationship management | Customer management, user management |
| **System Administrator** | Full administrative access | All MSP permissions plus system-level configuration |

## Role-Based Feature Access

Not all features and pages are visible to all users. The visibility depends on:

1. **User Role** — Determines which menu items and pages are accessible
2. **Feature Flags** — Features enabled for the customer organization (Cost, Security, Operations, etc.)
3. **Subscription Tier** — Some features require higher subscription tiers

:::note
Contact your vBox administrator if you need access to features that are not visible in your navigation menu.
