# vBox Documentation Update Rules

When updating documentation files in this Starlight project:

## Format
- Use standard Markdown (.md) for most pages. Use MDX (.mdx) only when Starlight components (Card, CardGrid, etc.) are needed.
- Always include frontmatter with `title` and `description` fields.
- Use `sidebar.order` in frontmatter to control page ordering within each section.

## Content
- Preserve existing screenshots unless explicitly told to replace them.
- Image placeholders use the format: `<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of [description] -->`
- When adding new screenshots, place them in `src/assets/images/[section]/` and reference with relative imports.
- Use Starlight admonitions: `:::note`, `:::tip`, `:::caution`, `:::danger` for callouts.

## Style
- Match the existing writing style: professional, concise, second-person ("you can...").
- Use tables for structured data comparisons.
- Include "Features" or "Key Capabilities" sections in overview pages.
- Link to related pages using absolute paths (e.g., `/integrations/defender-xdr/`).

## Cross-References
- Internal links use the format: `[Page Title](/section/page-slug/)`
- The site structure follows: getting-started, cost-management, security, operations, tasks, analytics, integrations, administration

## When updating for a new feature
1. Determine which section the feature belongs to
2. Create or update the relevant .md file
3. Update the section overview page if adding a new page
4. Update `astro.config.mjs` sidebar config if adding a new page that isn't auto-generated
